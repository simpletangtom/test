RNA quality was assessed using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies)	spia	ENCORE amplification and labeling kit (NuGen, San Carlos, CA) was applied to the first batch of samples starting with approximately 100ng of total RNA to generate biotin-labeled RNA fragments for hybridization to the chip. For samples with a low RNA concentration, the Nugen Ovation SPIA amplification kit (NuGen, San Carlos, CA) was applied.	9606	Hybriziation was performed by following Affymetrix standard procedure.
